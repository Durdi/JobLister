      "description": "### Overview\r\n\r\nAt [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), we’re building a platform to empower digital designers and developers to build better, more elaborate web projects than ever before. We’re aiming to change the landscape of modern web development.\r\n\r\nThe fullstack engineer's mission is to build the APIs and user interfaces that thousands of developers use when they deploy their sites on Netlify.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Some of the challenges you’ll be working on\r\n\r\n- Build new features to make working with Netlify a fantastic experience for developers.\r\n- Build internal tools to help our other teams interact with our users.\r\n- Integrate our [Open Source](/open-source) projects with the rest of Netlify's platform.\r\n- Make using our CLI a delightful experience for new and experienced users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### To be effective in this role, you’ll benefit from experience in:\r\n\r\n- Scripting programming languages. We use Ruby, with Rails as web framework, and JavaScript.\r\n- Writing web applications with a decoupled JavaScript frontend.\r\n- UI and UX experience.\r\n- Web and CDN technologies.\r\n- Internet standards like HTTP, DNS, and TLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Competencies that we value in candidates\r\n\r\n- You enjoy helping and mentoring other engineers to grow.\r\n- You can focus on key priorities and pragmatic solutions.\r\n- You can adjust quickly to changing priorities and conditions.\r\n- You are curious about compiled programming languages. We use Go and C++ in some areas of our infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### About the Team\r\n\r\nThough the team is small, we are a fast-growing startup. You will be working across the company. There are only less than twenty of us, so you are getting in at a time when we need people who can help us build a path towards the future.\r\n\r\nWe believe that empowered, engaged employees do the best work. We’ll be giving you the tools you need to succeed and looking to you for suggestions for improvement not just in your daily job, but in many other aspects of building a company. Whether you work from our main office in San Francisco, or you are a remote employee, we’ll be working together a lot - particularly, pairing and collaborating - we want you to succeed!  We don’t want you to work too hard (burnout is real), and we do want to encourage you to grow ([impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is also real) - and we’ll help you do that.\r\n\r\nNetlify is devoted to building a team of people with different backgrounds and lifestyles. We eagerly invite applications from people of all kinds. We don’t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, age, race, citizenship, pregnancy status, or any other differences. If we can do anything to provide a better interview, i.e. accommodate a disability, then please do let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How we hire\r\n\r\nOur hiring process starts as soon as you email us at [careers@netlify.com](mailto:careers@netlify.com). Please send us a thoughtful cover letter explaining why you enjoy building APIs and microservices, and why you’d like to work at Netlify.\r\n\r\nAfter we evaluate this email, we will schedule a conference call so we can meet. If you live in San Francisco, we usually substitute this call with a visit to our office. This first meeting helps us to learn more about your past experience and helps you to learn a little bit more about our company and how we work.\r\n\r\nIf we move forward with the process, we will work together in designing a test to evaluate your technical skills. We’ll invite you to join a dedicated Slack channel where we can reach each other and talk about the test.\r\n\r\nIf the test is successful, we'll schedule a next meeting with other members of the company that you’ll be working with, directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\nAfter this third interview, you’ll meet with the management team to discuss salary and other compensations.\r\n\r\n",

We're currently on the lookout for both mid and senior frontend engineers to join our team.\r\n\r\n## The unofficial job description\r\n\r\nYes, you'll be working with legacy code. TweetDeck has been around for a little while now. And no, we're not (yet) using React. \r\n\r\nFor the most part we use a framework called [Flight.js][2], which feels surprisingly similar to React. React is our end goal, and we're close, but we want to eradicate some of our legacy components first. \r\n\r\nI personally find the codebase really exciting. Tweets in columns sounds simple, right? But there is a whole world of complexity and logic to it. You'll constantly stumble into parts of the codebase that you never knew existed. There will always be something new to learn. \r\n\r\nYou'll also be joining TweetDeck at a really exciting time, both technically and for our users. We're currently exploring some brand new, greenfield projects, which will mean building lots of cool new features. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, you'll be joining an incredibly lovely and talented team. You'll be working closely with design, product management and TweetDeck's backend engineers.

You’ll work alongside talented individuals on groundbreaking projects for the world’s largest companies.\r\n \r\nOur workflow involves three steps. Designers hand off mockups to the HTML/CSS developers who then give styled templates to engineers.

In addition to that, you will be challenged with helping drive the creation of web applications and solving interesting problems regarding accessibility, browser compatibility, standards compliance, and responsive design.\r\n \r\n## Responsibilities\r\n \r\nLead the HTML & CSS development and architecture of modern web applications, operating between Design and Engineering teams, using industry best practices.\r\nAssist in scoping, estimating, and planning for projects, in collaboration with the team lead.\r\nAct as a mentor to others, guiding and influencing peers through work review, pairing, or other forms of knowledge sharing.\r\nIdentify and go after industry developments and business opportunities.\r\n\r\n## Must Haves\r\n \r\n* Advanced knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3\r\n* Experience with BEM and SMACSS\r\n* Experience with Sketch and/or Photoshop\r\n* Excellent communication skills\r\n\r\n## Nice to Haves\r\n\r\n* Knowledge of PostCSS\r\n* Prior client services, consulting, or freelancing experience\r\n* Experience working in a remote team\r\n\r\n## Level\r\n\r\nSenior\r\n\r\n## Employment Type\r\n\r\nFull-time, remote (U.S. only)\r\n\r\n## Apply\r\n\r\nPlease send an email to careers@dockyard.com with your contact information, a bit of background about yourself, and the reason why you are applying.\r\n\r\nAt DockYard, we value diversity and strongly encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.",

So if you want to work on an ambitious web platform supporting N26, powered by a robust yet recent tech stack shaped with fresh design, maybe we would be a good fit for you!\r\n\r\nRegarding skills & qualifications, you should obviously know a good deal of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You should be able (and willing) to work in a fast and efficient agile framework. And finally you should care about accessibility, performance and user experience. We would say almost everything else, such as knowledge in React and GraphQL is a plus.\r\n\r\n## What you will do\r\n\r\nWorking here, you will join our cross-disciplinary teams to work on N26 projects, such as the new website, the revamping of the web application, or the registration process. Our entire tech stack is unified across all web projects so the learning curve from one project to the other is practically non existant.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to know more about the said tech stack, you’ll be pleased to know we build and maintain a universal React application, fed with GraphQL, styled with Fela and covered with extensive tests (routes, accessibility,  end-to-end…). Nothing but the good!\r\n\r\n## How to apply\r\n\r\nGet in touch with [@HugoGiraudel](https://twitter.com/HugoGiraudel) on Twitter, or apply directly from the [official offer on N26.com](https://n26.com/jobs/126939/?gh_jid=126939).
